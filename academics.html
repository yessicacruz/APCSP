  <p>This school year has been filled with alot of ups and down. Especially this year being a junior in high school everything made me very stressed especially keeping up with all my classes. Ranging from Honors to AP classes, I felt like I had no time to waste except follow with the toughness of Honors English, Physics, Honors Spanish and APCSP. But on the bright side I think I have learned during my time in theses classes and I feel like I am more prepared for my senior year and the classes that I will be taking next year that are also harder.</p>
